###Map Project Optimization

##About:
A copy of this website is hosted on eyepublic.com

In it you will find a map of the Angkor complex with 12 different locations.  Explore photographs and information from flickr.com and wikipedia.org.

##How to operate:

Open index.html with a web browser or head over to eyepublic.com

Hover over the names of landmarks and see them highlighted.

Hover over the markers and see them highlighted with title.

Click on a marker or a list item to get an information window with a photograph of the area.  Click on wiki to learn more about the location from the wikipedia.  Click on album to see a collection of photographs from flickr.

You can use the search box to narrow the titles and markers on the map.

Use the hamburger menu to switch from location list to map (on a smaller screen).

##Error Handling
Data requests are either handled asynchronously or through separate tabs so that error is handled by either a "file not found" message or a "pictures did not load" tab alert.
