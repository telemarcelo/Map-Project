###Map Project Optimization

##About:
A copy of this website is hosted on eyepublic.com

In it you will find a map of the Angkor complex with 12 different locations.  Explore photographs and information from flickr.com and wikipedia.org.

##How to operate:

Open index.html with a web browser or head over to eyepublic.com

Hover over the names of landmarks and see them highlighted.

Hover over the markers and see them highlighted with title.

Click on a marker or a list item to get an information window with a flickr photograph of the area.  
You can use the search box to narrow the titles and markers on the map.

Use the hamburger menu to switch from location list to map (on a smaller screen).

##Error Handling

An alert notifies the user if Google Maps does not load
An "Image Not Found" is displayed in the info box in case flickr data is unavailable.

#Other

I simplified the design to only use flickr and not wikipedia since the boxes are too small to read
an article.

I made the entire app one page and index uses the MVC Knockout pattern.
